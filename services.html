      most new and experienced technicians when detecting fault and determining damage rate, thus helping them make 
      quick decisions in offering technical solutions.
      Though many tend to waiver the use of surface systems but has ignored the <strong><em>quality and standards</em></strong> 
      that makes the usage as effective as other major wiring like conduit system.
